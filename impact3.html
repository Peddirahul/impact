            <h3>MANALI</h3>
            
            <p2>Manali is synonymous streams and birdsong, forests and orchards and grandees of snow-capped mountains. Manali is the real starting point of an ancient trade route which crosses the Rohtang and Baralacha passes, and runs via Lahul and Ladakh to Kashmir while divergent road connects it with Spiti.The place is popular for its rich flora and fauna exhibits. From sighting a variety of reptiles, birds, and mammals, you will also find this place perfect for camping and trekking options.The mountainous state of Himachal Pradesh in Northern India is the perfect place to go as a backpacker who loves mountains, like me! It's best to take a bus to the city of Manali, beautifully situated surrounded by Himalayas. It's also the gateway to the remote state of Ladakh, where Buddhism is the main religion</p2>
